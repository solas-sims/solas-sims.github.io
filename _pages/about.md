The Solas suite is a new and ongoing hydrodynamic simulation project that aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the first epochs of star formation in our Universe, during what is known as the Cosmic Dawn. Occurring in the first billion years after the Big Bang, the Cosmic Dawn is characterized by the formation of the first stars and galaxies, which played a crucial role in shaping the Universe as we know it today.

To shed light on the (astro)physics of these primary luminous sources in our Universe, we plan to employ a "near-and-far" approach. Simulations of the first galaxies, across a wide mass range, are being planned to identify and quantify the important processes that shaped these galaxies. The Solas simulations will be an invaluable tool to compare with the current and upcoming observations as well as make predictions for future surveys.

Closer to home, we are interested in the signatures of the first stars in our local Universe. We make predictions for the remnants and signature encoded in the low-metallicity stars in and around the Local Group.
